title: 1984 Part 2 Chapter 2 Analysis
---


The first paragraph "Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The air seemed to kiss one's skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doves." shows how [[Winston]]'s life is going through a large change. 

This is shown by the fact that the surroundings contrast sharply with his usual surroundings and the fact that he will be meeting [[Julia]] who is a symbol against [[Big Brother]] and the [[Party]].

"**I'm corrupt to the bones**" this is important as it shows how they are going against the [[Party]]'s anti-sex league. This is furthered in the lines "**No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.**"

An attempt to have your own thoughts and feelings goes against the [[Party]] and [[Big Brother]]. The image of a war is used to shift the focus of the story from a romantic one back to a dystopia. It also helps the reader understand why violence is such a central part of their society. It's also ironic as they're protesting in a non-violent manner yet the image of war is used.
