title: 1984 Part 2 Chapter 1 Analysis
---

Chapter 1 starts off with [[Julia]] and [[Winston]] seeing each other in a corridor before [[Julia]] falls down. She falls onto her broken arm and cries out in pain. This causes [[Winston]] to feel empathy and compassion (which eventually leads to love), which he does not recognise and calls it "**A curious emotion**". This shows that the [[Party]] and [[Big Brother]] have crushed most positive human emotions in favour of loyalty to the regime.

[[Julia]] is part of the Fiction Department. She was carrying a _kaleidoscope_ which is similar to the paperweight from [[1984 Part 1 Chapter 8 Analysis]]. The kaleidoscope is a symbol for how the [[Party]] is manipulating the past to suit their views, which makes the past more confusing, similar to how a kaleidoscope messes up what you can see.

"Her face turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain". We'll come back to this quote later.

This also shows that [[Winston]] is not completely brainwashed as he still believes that [[Julia]] is out to kill him, yet he also sees her as "**a human creature, in pain**". This could show that [[Winston]] is able to look past what he believes to be true and help someone regardless. It also shows that the basic human nature to help still exists and shows how this isn't meant to be felt. This is furthered when you realise that [[Winston]] has not felt either compassion or empathy during his life (at least not that he can remember). The sentence "**His heart bumped with frightening loudness**" helps show that he hasn't felt this emotion before.

The fall was an intentional move by [[Julia]] to pass a note to [[Winston]] discreetly. This shows that [[Julia]] is aware of [[Winston]]'s compassion. I find this interesting as [[Winston]] has not shown any compassion or empathy prior to this point, yet was predictable enough that [[Julia]] knew he would help her. 

The note reads "**I LOVE YOU**". This is a clear act of defiance to the regime, made even more delusional by the fact that [[Winston]] and [[Julia]] _have never even spoken_ prior to her fall. It could show how love triumphs all, but I believe it is far more likely that [[Julia]] is the exception not the rule. The phrase ""**incriminating thing into the memory hole**" shows that he is well aware of the danger of meeting [[Julia]]. More interestingly, [[Winston]] feels that the note passed to him could result in his death, shown by the line "**At the sight of the words I LOVE YOU the desire to stay alive had welled up**". Despite this, [[Winston]] still wishes to meet her, if only to have sex.

[[Winston]] concocts a plan to speak to her, even if only for a few seconds, by sitting at her table during lunch. He also relates the difficulty of making contact to "**trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated**" using a simile. This also shows how the [[Party]] is effectively playing chess with their population, trying to keep them under control. I find the choice of the lunchroom ironic as despite the number of telescreens and the number of people in the room, it is still the safest method of making contact. This is explicitly stated when [[Julia]] says "**It doesn't matter if there's a crowd**" when [[Winston]] mentions the number of telescreens in Victory Square.

Sibilance is used in the sentences "**Already a dense mass of people was  blocking the south side of the square. [[Winston]], at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage,  shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd**" to show that what he is doing is eerie.

The phrase "**In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms**" is interesting as these colours are usually used to describe positive events and are instead used to describe prisoners.

The phrase "**the people still insatiably gaping**" shows that the populace are eager to witness violence. This is linked to [[1984 Part 1 Chapter 1 Analysis]] where [[Winston]] describes the cinema and [[1984 Part 1 Chapter 2 Analysis]] where the child shoots [[Winston]] pretending that he is a Eurasian traitor.

The line "**And the gate's got no top bar**" said by [[Julia]] is interesting as she doesn't use perfect grammar. This may be a sign that she's spent a lot of time with the [[Proles]] or was even a Prole herself before working for the [[Party]].
