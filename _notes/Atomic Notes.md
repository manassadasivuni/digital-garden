title: Atomic Notes
---

Atomic notes is a way of **structuring** notes and the content they have. This paradigm refers to having _only a single topic_ within one note. This means that a note can be referred to at any point regardless of context and still have the same meaning. It also helps separate topics that could be elaborated upon without intruding on another part of the note.
