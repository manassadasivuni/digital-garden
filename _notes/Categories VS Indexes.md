title: Categories VS Indexes
---

Categories and indexes are both methods of organisation. The main difference is how objects relate to each other within these structures.

The most common example of categories is the file structure with each sub-folder being **a part** of the folder above it. In the following example:

- Animals
	- Dogs
		- Pugs
		 - Poodle

"Pugs", and "Poodle" are inherent parts of "Dogs". This can be seen as inflexible and rigid as it doesn't allow for topics to branch out into less related but still relevant ideas. In addition, it causes more nuanced sub-topics to be engulfed by the parent folder. On the other hand, Indexes allow for **relations** to be formed. This means that associations can be made to more general topics without forcing more specific topics or topics that could easily fit under multiple parent folders to be confined to a single name. 

This results in acknowledgments being made rather than a sub-topic yielding its specificity to a higher-level category.
