Markdown is a way of typing HTML code in a more human-friendly way. It is based off of plain-text files that can then be converted into fully formatted pages.

## Headings
There are 6 different types of headings from H1 to H6 which decrease in order of importance. A heading can be typed by a `#` character followed by a space and the heading text. The heading level is shown by the number of hashes it has. For example, a H3 would have 3 hashes.

## Formatted text
_Italics_ - \_italics_ or \*italics*

**Bold** - \_\_bold\_\_ or \*\*bold\*\*

***You can use them together***

You can also ~~strike words out~~

- Unordered list
	- AKA bullet lists
	- more bullets

1. Numbered lists
	1. indented list

- they can
	1. be used together

> Blockquotes

Links are made with this syntax \[what you see on the page](where the link goes to). For example, [my blog](https://manassadasivuni.com).

`inline code` can be typed by surrounding text with this symbol: \`

You can also make code blocks by using three backticks:

```js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
