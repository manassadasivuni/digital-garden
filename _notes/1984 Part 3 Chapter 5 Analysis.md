title: 1984 Part 3 Chapter 5 Analysis
---


The chapter starts with [[Winston]] being taken to [[Room 101]]. The tone is set in the first page of the chapter with [[O'Brien]] saying "**The thing that is in [[Room 101]] is the worst thing in the world.**" For Winston, this is rats as foreshadowed in [[1984 Part 2 Chapter 4 Analysis]].

The purpose of this chapter is to show that his love and loyalty to [[Julia]] can be broken with fear and emphasises the role of fear in controlling the people of Oceania. In addition, it shows the futility of trying to defy the [[Party]] as [[Winston]]'s sole goal was to ensure that he would never betray [[Julia]] and he has failed by trying to sacrifice her for his own wellbeing ("**Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!**")
