title: 1984 Part 2 Chapter 9 Analysis
---
The chapter beginning with a change in enemy emphasises how much power the [[Party]] has over reality as "**there was ... no admission that any change had taken place**". This shows that regardless of how outlandish or extreme the view of the [[Party]] is, the populace will believe it to be true. This is also ironic as later on in the chapter, [[Winston]] realises that it is in the best interest of the government to perpetuate war.

The book read by [[Winston]] describes the ongoing class struggle in a very similar way to how Marxism describes it. It also shows how perpetuated war is ideal for the upper class and that for the poor to be kept in their place, they must be unaware of the actions being taken against them.

[[Julia]] enters and is uninterested in the book as it does not affect her, or at least does not have a _new_ effect on her. The book goes on to explain how the [[Proles]] are able to overthrow the middle and upper classes but are regarded as unintelligent. This can be related to [[Winston]]'s prior comment about how "**If there is hope, it lies in the proles**".
