title: 0018 - Time Capsule 1
---

It's been just over two months since my last [[0017 - 5AM]] and a lot has happened. Before we get right into it, this is meant to be a time capsule of sorts ~~like mentioned in the title~~ and is just going to document how things are at this exact moment in time.

HUSMUN is finally over, it turns out that the first mention of it was all the way back in July. I've already said what I had to say in my [blog post about it](https://manassadasivuni.com/husmun/).

## School
Our midterms finished earlier this month (in the first week of October, I think) and I've already started preparing for the term-end exams. After all, they're going to be used to calculate my predicted grades and I really have to do better. I got a 32/42 overall which is pathetic especially since I'm aiming for LSE.

I'm aiming for at least a 36, which would be a 6 in all subjects. Considering that my grades for the midterm were HL 555 and SL 755, this means that I have to improve by a single grade in all my subjects.

### HL Maths
I need a 7 in this subject by the end of the next academic year if I want to meet the _standard_ requirement for the BSc Finance at LSE. This is a non-negotiable subject so I have to do my best. I got the Cambridge textbook which has good questions to practice from (apparently) and I've been going through that.

I know most of the theory in this subject as I took Additional Maths last year in my IGCSEs but I still need to practice quite a lot with questions. On the bright side, the questions that have been marked as "You need to be able to solve these to get a 7" in the textbook (the questions are colour-coded) haven't been too difficult. 

I've been able to get roughly half of those right and everything else prior to it correct as well. That being said, I haven't done questions from the more complicated chapters yet. The syllabus for the term-end exams goes up to section 8 or exercise 51 and I've only does up to exercise 4.

### HL Economics
I thought I had nailed this exam in the midterms but clearly not. When we went through the paper in class, I could see where my answers were lacking. These are the general tips I have to keep in mind for the term-end exams:
- Always draw a diagram and explain it if the question is about something even remotely related to a diagram
    - Demand and supply graphs are obvious
    - Substitution and income effect have to be practiced
    - Tax diagrams
- Be able to explain the graphs thoroughly
- Learn how to link diagrams to something completely random (who knew marginal benefit and the demand curve were linked)
- Use terminology _**and define/explain them**_

I'll also have to write a lot faster, or at least waste less time. I'm going through the textbook, taking notes in Obsidian, then making cards in Anki but I need to practice questions as well.

### HL Physics
I haven't done anything for this since the mid-terms. I need to get the textbook and do the practice questions in there. Then I need to get past paper questions and do those. 

### SL English
This is such a hit-or-miss subject. The only thing I can hope to have is a cohesive essay. I need to figure out how to bullshit stuff spontaneously. I also have to re-read 1984 and pay closer attention to detail.

### SL Spanish
Go through the Anki cards that I made and actually practice the language. Go read Spanish news articles and just breathe Spanish. Change Chrome's language to Spanish and Windows 10 to it while you're at it.

_**Learn conjugating in the past tense. Memorise the general rule for it in both tenses**_

### SL Business
Business is chill, I got a 7 in it in the mid-terms. I just need to flick through Section 2 since the classes on it have been all but useless. Maybe I could skip forward to Section 2 and come back to Section 1 later (I'm currently on Chapter 1.3 in terms of taking textbook notes)

## Misc
My blog's doing quite well and I clearly underestimated how well I can promote my posts. I've hit 540 followers on my Instagram and 156 people saw my last story after the 24 hour period was up. Clearly my social network is larger than I thought. [Zoice](http://zoice.org) should help with expanding it even further.
