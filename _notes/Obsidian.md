[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a note taking app that features wikilinks (\[\[ \]\]) and [bi-directional linking](/bi-directional-links){: .internal-link} (notes are aware of where they've been mentioned).

It operates on [[Markdown]] files to format notes and is my personal favourite for taking notes.
