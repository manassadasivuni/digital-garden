title: 1984 Part 3 Chapter 1 Analysis
---

This is the beginning of the end for [[Winston]], he had finally been caught for thoughtcrime. The cell [[Winston]] is in is the [[1984 Part 2 Chapter 8 Analysis#^place-where-there-is-no-darkness|place where there is no darkness]] mentioned previously.

An interesting point is a contrast between the prisoners who were [[Party]] members and the captured [[Proles]]. The [[Party]] members were raised to understand the true power of the [[Party]] and are rightly terrified. 

While the [[Proles]] talk about the forced-labour camps, they mentioned that "**the dirty jobs were done by the politicals**". This could show that Orwell believes that an uprising, such as that mentioned in [[1984 Part 2 Chapter 9 Analysis]], would occur in these camps, a small rebellion against the social order created by the  [[Big Brother]] and the [[Party]]. 

[[Winston]] imagines physical torture which he believes would make him betray [[Julia]]. Surprisingly, he still trusts [[O'Brien]] and hopes that [[O'Brien]] will send him a razor for him to commit suicide with.

A man called Ampleforth is thrown into the cell with [[Winston]]. Ampleforth's crime was including the word "God" in the translation of a poem. This could be Orwell's way of saying that under a totalitarian government, the free speech of writers is non-existent.

Ampleforth is then taken away to [[Room 101]] and Parsons (the neighbour from [[1984 Part 1 Chapter 2 Analysis]]) enters. Parsons had committed thoughtcrime _in his sleep_ and was heard by _his daughter_ who turned him into the [[Party]]. This shows how thoroughly the [[Party]] has removed familial attachment. Surprisingly, Parsons _is proud_ of his daughter for turning him in and says "**In fact, I'm proud of her. It shows I brought her up in the right spirit, anyway.**"

The mystery and suspense surrounding [[Room 101]] is heightened when a man _on the brink of starvation_ attempts to resist the guards instead of letting himself be taken there.

[[Winston]]'s hope of being given a razor blade by the Brotherhood is shattered when [[O'Brien]] enters the cell. [[O'Brien]] reveals himself to be part of Miniluv and implies that [[Winston]] always knew that he was being tricked.
