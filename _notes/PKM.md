This stands for Personal Knowledge Management which is about how we store and use [[information]] in our day-to-day lives. For most, this may be through email or study notes (if you're a student) but it can also expand to the creation of your own ideas. 

In fact, PKM is most used in reference to taking information from literature or other sources to turn into notes that have some original input. Common methods of doing so are [[Zettelkasten]] and [[Evergreen Notes]].
