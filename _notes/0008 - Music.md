title: 0008 - Music

Music is a pretty big part of most people's lives. I find that I usually have some form of it playing in the background, whether it be during an online class or while I'm writing yet another 1000 word essay. In all honesty, it's become such a core part of my life that I'm genuinely shocked when someone says that they don't listen to it.

You see, music is a representation of who you are. So much so that it's been found different personality types collectively have different tastes. For example, my personality type tends to enjoy alternative music as well as electronica and pop. I've seen these in my own listening history and they tend to crop up quite often. 

My music taste usually goes through phases. For example, I was quite into a specific blend of pop and rap that I found in the album [TECHNICOLOUR Vol. 1 by ieuan](https://open.spotify.com/album/4akbmXCsJgFBE9RYSxHsGS?si=kMjf4OIESz-IF1XFkLlZug). Right after that, I leaned toward electric, jingly songs like that of Snail's House and right now I'm just vibing to Isaac Dunbar.

In fact, my taste shifts so much that I've just given up trying to define it by genre. What I do instead is to describe the general feel of the songs. At the moment, I'd describe my taste as upbeat and eclectic as well as low-energy. This doesn't mean that I don't enjoy other kinds of music, I just have a relatively stable "core" of music with arms that tend to flap around a lot and latch onto whatever's within their grasp.

Another thing about music is that it can affect us physically and mentally. For music to affect you physically, there's quite a simple set up:
- Find a song with a really good bass
- Put a speaker on your chest or in your lap
- Play the song on max volume

Music affecting you mentally is a bit more complicated, mainly due to the various effects it has on you. For one, it's said to improve your creativity although this is limited to only a few genres such as ambient noise and instrumentals. It can also affect your mood. You may not be surprised by that fact, but it still works in an interesting way. The main example being the fact that listening to sad songs when you're sad will actually help to stabilise your mood rather than increasing your sadness.

Music can also serve as a time capsule. You know when you randomly hear a few seconds of a song that takes you back a few years and you're flooded with all the memories? That's precisely what I mean by music being a time capsule. I don't know why this happens, especially with a song you haven't heard in a couple of years. Perhaps it just reflects how our brains prioritise information? Maybe they just give more importance to sounds compared to visuals.

One interesting thing I found about music was that playlists are a lot better than I originally thought. You see, I used to just hit play and hope that I would get the songs that I wanted to hear or would play songs only by one artist. Since then, I've made a few playlists for different moods and purposes.

I don't usually have a preference between my playlists as they do share a fair amount of songs, but I do use them. In the event that I'm not feeling picky about what I hear, I have an "everything" playlist where I just add songs that I like. Sometimes it'll go to the oldest songs and I'll be hit with a wave of nostalgia. Other times, I'll unearth a gem of a song I forgot about.

### Where to get music
The way that I listen to music is to use Spotify. It syncs across all my devices and it lets me do this thing where I can play music from my phone onto an external speaker but control the music from my laptop. Yes, I could play it directly from my laptop but I've found it doesn't have the smoothest Bluetooth connection and you tend to get a lot of rubberbanding and it's painful more than anything.

Another one of the reasons I use Spotify is because their recommendation game is on point. They know exactly what I want when I want it. Plus, you can also see playlists your friends have made which tend to be pretty good as well. In case I still haven't sold you on Spotify, they collect a list of the songs you've been enjoying recently and put them into a playlist meaning that your favourite tunes are sitting there waiting for you. One of the downsides to Spotify is that their algorithm is too good and doesn't adjust to a change in taste as fast as I would like but that's my only criticism of them.

Another platform that I've used is YouTube! They may not be what first comes to mind when thinking of music but it's possible. If you find that the music alone isn't as stimulating as you'd like, you can always opt to watch the music video as well. YouTube does also have a good recommendation algorithm but I find that the platform is too inconvenient for music, partly due to the fact that they load the next page in its entirety which adds a gap between songs.

The reason I'm not talking about other platforms like Apple Music and Deezer is simply because I've never used them and won't be an accurate judge on them. I'm sure that they have their positives and negatives but I wouldn't know anything about them.

Just before we wrap this post off, please listen to this song ðŸ‘‡, it's the most peaceful song I've ever heard.
