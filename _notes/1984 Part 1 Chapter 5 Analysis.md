title: 1984 Part 1 Chapter 5 Analysis
---

Syme is an interesting character as he is completely and utterly smitten with the word of [[Big Brother]] and the [[Party]] but is still likely to be vaporised simply because he's just really smart. One interesting point is that he revels in the _destruction_ of words as opposed to their creation. This - hauntingly - shows that it will soon be impossible for any member of the population to oppose the [[Party]] because they won't know such a thing is possible.

[[Winston]] is shown as unique in this Chapter simply because he has enough agency and memory that he questions the statements that the chocolate ration had been _increased_ to 20 grams rather than decreased
