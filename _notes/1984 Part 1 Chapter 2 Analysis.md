Even with the panic caused by the knock on the door, [[Winston]] still decided not to close the diary as he didn't want to smudge the paper. This shows how he is trying to preserve the diary in the hope it can explain this time period to someone in the future. 

The population are instructed to use "comrade" instead of "Mr and Ms" which further hints at communist undertones. While fixing Mrs Parsons' sink, the behaviour of the boy (loyal only to the [[Party]], accusing people of thoughtcrime and begging to see a public execution) shows how indoctrinated the population is and how those children will grow up to be willingly manipulated by the [[Party]].

[[Winston]] then goes back and contemplates why he is keeping the diary and eventually comes to the conclusion that he is doing so to keep himself sane. He also realises that the only way to defy the reality manipulation practiced by the [[Party]] is by keeping his own record of things.
