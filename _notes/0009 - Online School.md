title: 0009 - Online School
---

Since there's a global pandemic on the loose, doing anything in-person has become unnecessarily dangerous. This has led to a lot of things that were normally physically done to be shifted online. One of these is school. 

I previously finished my IGCSEs and have started my first year in the IBDP. The IBDP is known for its rigour and is widely described as the hardest high school diploma programme in the world. The thought that I'd begin one of the hardest years of my academic life in a hindered state was quite daunting.

Not only did I have to learn how to learn effectively, my teachers had to figure out how to move all their lesson plans online and find a way to keep us engaged and productive during their lessons. I knew I could count on myself to find a way that worked for me. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a little known app called Obsidian which is designed to model how your brain functions. I now use it to take my notes for school and have customised it so that it fits my needs perfectly.

On the other end, most of my teachers were able to smoothly transition onto a digital medium of teaching. The ones that couldn't tended to have some sort of problem with the software they were using or the setup of their laptops. Over time, these wrinkles were ironed out.

As of now, I've spent the last month and a half learning purely digitally. I've found that the lessons became easier. Not because I'm an excellent student but because I could quickly Google something up if I didn't understand without holding up the entire class. Plus, my notes are digital meaning that I can quickly search through them for past notes on the current topic in a heartbeat.

I've also been able to free up more time for other activities such as writing 1000 words everyday. This is in part because I have a few extra-curricular activities that were cancelled thanks to the pandemic. I've also managed to build a new website, my personal blog, as well as this site. I do have to add in a disclaimer that not everyone will be spending their time productively, I can guarantee others have used the extra time to lounge around. 

Now onto the downsides. My main complaint is the fact that I have to stare at a screen for about 7 hours a day excluding time taken for homework and other academic activities. I've tried to setup my laptop as best as I could by using a low brightness as well as changing all the visual settings so that I'm more comfortable. 

Despite this, I can still feel a strain. I'm not the only one who does, my classmates have also experienced the same thing and have sent a few email to our school's management asking for them to shorten our timetable to become more manageable. I really wished there was a way to reduce the effect of this but apart from not using a screen, I can't seem to find one (some of my classmates use anti-glare filters so that may be an option).

One of the other negative effects is that there's no social cues in class. This ends up with two people talking over each other to answer a question or a prolonged silence where everyone wait for someone else to speak. These are inconvenient to say the least but they've occurred less and less the more we've got used to the entire online learning thing. I doubt they'll go away but we can live with them. 

Another negative is that it's a lot easier to become distracted during class. Partly because you're not in a classroom where everyone is paying attention to the teacher but also because our laptops are loaded with features that make it easy to lose track of what you're meant to be doing. Well, not the laptop's themselves, more the websites and apps available.

This can be a good thing as well. Not the distraction but the multitude of apps. I tend to get stuck on a problem in math quite often and I usually talk to a friend about it during the time allotted specifically for solving problems. If I still don't understand what to do, I'll either ask the teacher to explain or to see their working out. I would do this in a physical school anyway, it's just possible to do it online as well.

While I do not get to see my friends physically, I can still interact with them in a comparable way to a physical school. During our break and lunch, it's quite normal to receive a group call and we'll just chat and talk about whatever we feel like. The social dynamic is still there, just less clear and visible.

One of the unexpected things that has helped me quite a lot in online school is having a monitor. This means that I have not one, but two screens in front of me (technically one is to the side but you get the point). This is the single most thing you can do to boost your productivity in online school. It allows me to have Google Meet or Zoom open while taking notes without having to swap visible windows or awkwardly splitting my screen in half.

Another thing that helps me is having some sort of background noise. I tend to use a playlist I have dedicated to lofi and similar songs. Since the playlist is 48 hours long, I just hit shuffle and let it play. This doesn't really get me "in the zone" but it does stop me from hearing the background noise from my teacher's microphone, which can be surprisingly distracting. Plus I just really enjoy music so it's a win-win for me.
