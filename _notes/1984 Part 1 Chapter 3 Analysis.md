title: 1984 Part 1 Chapter 3 Analysis

[[Winston]]'s mother was the last person to show him unconditional love and acts as a reminder of the past where emotional ties were valued rather than unquestioning loyalty. The "girl with dark hair" then enters his dream and removes her clothes which is a clear symbol of resistance as it goes against everything the [[Thought Police]] and the [[Party]] do.

The fact that members of the Outer [[Party]] cannot afford a set of pajamas further emphasises the class difference, even within those in the [[Party]]. During the Physical Jerks, [[Winston]] realises that the [[Party]] controls the past, present, and future and that even his own memory is called into question by this data manipulation.
