title: Index

These are notes that are created to keep a track of other notes that are in that topic. These are also known as "MOCs" from the [LYT Kit](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/000+Home).

The aim of having Indexes is so that they can serve as an entry point. Want to find notes relating to productivity? Go to \[\[Productivity\]\] and see what links to it. I prefer to call them Indexes as they're not as rigid as categories (see [[Categories VS Indexes]]) but still provide valuable structure to this garden.
