Dates: September 14th 2020 - September 28th 2020

As I am organising HUSMUN and will be chairing, I wanted to have some prior experience beforehand. While I have attended MUNs before, I have never chaired a committee. Before the event, I thought that this would be quite a challenge as there are multiple aspects you need to maintain simultaneously during the committee sessions. I asked other members of the MUN to give me a few pointers so I wasn't going in completely blind.

In addition to gaining tips for chairing, I collaborated with my other Executive Board members in the creation of a study guide. I am quite a good writer (if I do say so myself) but my preferred writing style is informal and causal which wasn't appropriate for a formal debate. This meant that I had to modify my normal way of writing to suit the event.

During the actual event, I had to stimulate the debate quite frequently as the delegates were not speaking or challenging each other. This was quite challenging as I lacked experience. To add to this, the most experienced member of my executive board was unable to attend parts of the MUN due to prior commitments.

I feel that this was not the best example on how to effectively manage a debate as there was limited conflict between delegates which is not representative of the average MUN. That being said, it is better than having no experience.
