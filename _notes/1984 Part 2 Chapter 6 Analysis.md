title: 1984 Part 2 Chapter 6 Analysis

"_His name has slipped my memory for the moment_". This quote refers to Syme who was revealed to be vaporised in [[1984 Part 2 Chapter 5 Analysis]]. This hints at [[O'Brien]]'s possible unorthodoxy as he is referring to a non-existent person and therefore committing thoughtcrime. This solidifies [[Winston]]'s hunch ("_obviously have been intended as a signal, a codeword_"). 

[[Winston]] interprets [[O'Brien]]'s offer of the latest dictionary to be a ruse and that he was in fact part of an organised rebellion. The book has been building up to this point as this is the culmination of [[Winston]]'s character-building showing that he is a rebel to the [[Party]]. This is also the point where [[Winston]]'s fate is sealed as he willingly steps into the trap laid for him.
