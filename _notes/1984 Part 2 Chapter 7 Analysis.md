title: 1984 Part 2 Chapter 7 Analysis
---
[[Winston]] and [[Julia]] are in the room above [[Mr Charrington]]'s shop when [[Winston]] wakes from a nightmare. By sharing his past, their relationship deepens. [[Julia]] is uninterested. This causes [[Winston]] to realise that all the [[Party]] members had been conditioned to ignore their emotions. By having any form of relationship, they were going against the will of the [[Party]] and from his point of view, were becoming human again.

This is shown in the line "**The proles had stayed human**" and the fact that the most prominent aspect of the [[Proles]] is their ability to express emotion. The pair then discuss what they will do in the event that they are captured and come to the conclusion that confessing their crime is not betrayal but "**If they could make me stop loving you - that would be the real betrayal**". This is very clearly ironic and foreshadows what will actually happen to them.

This also shows how much control the [[Party]] has over the populace as the chapter ends with the line "**the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable**" and implies that the [[Party]] is able to break through seemingly impossible barriers
