title: A Diatribe On Inspiration
---

Inspiration is inspiration. The form it comes in is irrelevant to the message and the meaning it carries. The form can often be the inspiration but in that case, wouldn't that make the form the message and not the carrier? Attempting to confine inspiration to a single object ignores the point of what inspiration should be.

It should be the reason you pick up the pen and write. It should be why you create and leave your mark on the world. It should be an excuse to indulge yourself in the power of words. 

Inspiration is not a "thing" it is a "why".

While inspiration holds power over us all and leaves us creators at its mercy, it's visible in the most mundane parts of life. The sunlight seeping through your window. The music in my ears. The crackle of a leaf under their foot.

Inspiration is omniscient and omnipresent and omnipotent and yet, ignorant and nowhere and weak. And so, so be it.
