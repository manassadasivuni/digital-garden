title: 1984 Part 3 Chapter 4 Analysis
---


"**It would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time, if he had felt any interest in doing so**" shows how [[Winston]] has given up control of his physical self and has decided to accept the decisions of the [[Party]]. Interestingly, he still holds hope of being reunited with [[Julia]]. This shows that he has not completely given in to the will of the [[Party]] and still has some original thought.

Doublethink is shown in this chapter as he dreams that [[O'Brien]] is with him in the Golden Country. This implies that [[Winston]] thinks of [[O'Brien]], his torturer, as a friend and helps to show the extent of Stockholm Syndrome on [[Winston]].

"**He could not move out of a walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length**" gives the reader a sense of how weak [[Winston]] was after his torture. It serves as a stark contrast to the beginning of the chapter in which he dreams of paradise.

[[Winston]] now believes that "**Sanity was statistical**" which is a direct opposition to what he said in [[1984 Part 2 Chapter 10 Analysis]] ("Sanity is not statistical"). This shows he now believes that **the majority is always right** and is also shown in the quote "**how could the immortal, collective brain be mistaken?**".

> "**Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence**"
