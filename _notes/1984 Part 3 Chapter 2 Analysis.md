[[Winston]] was physically tortured for an unknown amount of time ("**How long he had been down there he did not know**").

"**The confession was a formality, though the torture was real**" shows that despite the fact that the [[Party]] is aware of the crime committed, they insist on the person confessing to it. This could be to maintain the image of not being a totalitarian government.

The care being shown to [[Winston]] during his torture could foreshadow the fact that he will be forgiven for his crime and will be put back into society (if they intended to kill him, he wouldn't receive care). 

"**The aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning**" shows that the [[Party]] is aware that the ideas they spread do not make logical sense and that the only barrier they face in controlling the population of Oceania is the reasoning and thoughts of the people.

This section is ironic as [[Winston]] previously imagined himself dying in defiance of the [[Party]] yet now he is saying anything ("**He confessed to \[...] sabotage of every kind**") just to make the torture stop. This is shown by the lines "**His sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the bullying started anew**".

[[Winston]] believed that he could hear [[O'Brien]] and that [[O'Brien]] was in charge of the torture he was being put through. 

[[Winston]] wakes up to see [[O'Brien]] looking down at him before being electrocuted. The setting is at 40 but it goes up to 100. [[O'Brien]] asks [[Winston]] multiple questions about the past, all of which have to do with memory and the truth. One of them is about a photograph which [[O'Brien]] puts into a memory hole. [[Winston]] says:

"**But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it. You remember it**"

"**I do not remember it**" replies [[O'Brien]]. This is an example of the doublethink that [[Winston]] must learn. This shows how the [[Party]]'s power is from controlling all records of the past ("**We, the [[Party]], control all records and we control all memories**").

[[O'Brien]] then breaks down [[Winston]]'s one absolute truth: [[1984 Part 1 Chapter 7 Analysis#^two-plus-two-make-four| that two plus two make four]]. This is done by forcing [[Winston]] to make use of doublethink and to **_genuinely_ see five fingers when only four exist**. If [[Winston]] can see five when four exist, he would have successfully used doublethink and is under the will of the [[Party]].

"**It is not easy to become sane**" is an interesting choice of words. It implies that [[Winston]] seeing the truth (which goes against the [[Party]]'s word) is the act of a madman. It also shows that the only way to survive under the regime of the [[Big Brother]] and maintain a semblance of rationality is to submit to the word of the [[Party]] without questioning why.

This is reinforced when [[Winston]] says "**Four, five, six - in all honesty I don't know**" which implies that he has given up trying to maintain a version of the truth and has decided to give in to the word of the [[Party]]. This is confirmed when [[O'Brien]] replies with "**Better**"

[[Winston]] was taken to the Ministry of Love for torture. After his torture from [[O'Brien]] had ended, he begins to feel _genuine love_ for [[O'Brien]]. This could be a reference to [[Winston]]'s initial impression of [[O'Brien]] all the way back in [[1984 Part 1 Chapter 1 Analysis]].

> **The command of the old despotisms was "Thou shalt not". The command of the totalitarians was "Thou shalt". Our command is "THOU ART"**

This shows the progress made by oppressive regimes from merely indicating what _not_ to do to giving each person an identity that they can't deviate from. This is emphasised in the line "**We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves**".
