"She had named a place where they could meet after work, four evenings hence. It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing thread. If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition."

This ties into how [[Julia]] and [[Winston]] have confessed to being "corrupt to the bone". It also sounds very suspicious, as if they're spies. Arguably they are, as they are engaging in an illegal activity. This shows how [[Julia]] is able to work within the system and also do prohibited activities as she's done this multiple times.

The line "**I've got to put in two hours for the Junior Anti-Sex League**" is clearly ironic as she's just had sex and is about to tell other's not to do it. It could show the difference between [[Julia]] and [[Winston]] as she merely sees it as a chore and doesn't agree with it. By this, she's able to do what society asks of her without feeling anything as she is able to separate her own emotions from her duties to the [[Party]]. 

[[Julia]] is involved in much more activities than [[Winston]]. She views this as camouflage and is shown by the line "**If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones**". This refers to how she helps organise many activities. she can go against the [[Party]] in more obvious ways, such as having sex. 

"Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel with thirty other girls (â€™Always in the stink of women! How I hate women!â€™ she said parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing machines in the Fiction Department. She enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor. She was â€˜not cleverâ€™, but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery. She could describe the whole process of composing a novel, from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to the final touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not interested in the finished product. She "didnâ€™t much care for reading," she said. Books were just a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces."

The reason we only find out about [[Julia]] now is because this is the point where [[Winston]] gets to know her. The narrator is from the perspective of [[Winston]]. It also keeps her as a mysterious figure and reinforces the idea that she displays a facade to most of society. She does not undergo much change as a character, but our opinion of her changes as we learn more. 

"There are only six plots" could be Orwell commenting on the state of literature today. For example, Marvel movies are the same plot with different characters and locations.
