# Entry Points (aka Indexes)
These are notes that are created to keep a track of other notes that are in that topic. These are also known as "MOCs" from the [LYT Kit](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/000+Home).

The aim of having Indexes is so that they can serve as an entry point. Want to find notes relating to productivity? Go to \[\[Productivity\]\] and see what links to it. I prefer to call them Indexes as they're not as rigid as categories (see [[Categories VS Indexes]]) but still provide valuable structure to this garden.


# Tags and metadata structure

## Tags
- #ðŸŒ± - ideas that have just begun their existence
- #ðŸŒ¿ - ideas that have been fleshed out but not completed
- #ðŸŒ² - completed ideas (aka [[Evergreen Notes]])

## Metadata
At the bottom of each note, there'll be a common structure of information:

- Index: \[\[Name of the index\]\]
- Status: [see #tags](#tags){: .internal-link}
- Origin: Where did I come across this topic (or did I come up with it by myself?)
- Links:
  - \[\[What topics does this note link to?\]\]
