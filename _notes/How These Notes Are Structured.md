title: How these notes are structured
---

These notes will have some form of long-form writing which will have my thoughts on a particular topic. **Every note will have _at least_ some original thoughts**. They'll then be followed by some metadata.

## Tags and metadata structure

### Tags
These are not tags in the traditional sense that they are indicators of topic. Instead, they indicate the _status_ of a particular note. 

- #ðŸŒ± - ideas that have just begun their existence
- #ðŸŒ¿ - ideas that have been fleshed out but not completed
- #ðŸŒ² - completed ideas (aka [[Evergreen Notes]])

### Metadata
At the bottom of each note, there'll be a common structure of information:

- Index: \[\[Name of the index\]\]
- Status: [see \#tags](#tags){: .internal-link}
- Origin: Where did I come across this topic (or did I come up with it by myself?)
- Links:
  - \[\[What topics does this note link to?\]\]
