title: 0010 - Consistency
---

So this is quite a milestone: 10,000 words written over 10 days. Looking back on what I've written, it's felt a lot longer than 10 days. I don't know whether it's felt this way since I've begun this challenge or if I just have so much more to do that time seems to blend together. Either way, let's not delve into my perception of time right now and let's celebrate this milestone, it's the first on a very long journey.

Okay, now onto my thoughts for today: consistency. As far as I'm concerned, consistency is about doing something on a regular basis. This ranges from writing 1000 words a day (successfully, I might add) to being able to pull off a frame perfect speedrun every time. Some of you might disagree with me, which is perfectly okay. Consistency is a fairly abstract concept as it does have some common features between everyone's definition of it but there's also certain nuances that are specific and unique to that person. 

The largest disagreement I could find in terms of the definition of consistency involves chefs, as all large controversies do. You see, rather than thinking of consistency as an act or as a persistent sequence of events, chefs believe that consistency is actually a physical property that can be manipulated to suit their needs. Curiously, this is only the case where liquids are concerned, leading to many chefs adjusting the thickness of the liquid so that they can achieve the exact consistency needed for the dish.

Anyway, joke's aside, consistency is an art. Just like all forms of art, it can be improved with practice and effort. The downside to this is that you actually have to try and get better at this, meaning that you have to practice and put in effort. It's quite an unreasonable necessity in all honesty.

This need for deliberate practice is one of the main reasons I rarely stick to an activity unless I genuinely find enjoyment and satisfaction in doing it. One of the many things I started but eventually stopped was having a YouTube channel. I wanted to be able to put out high quality and engaging content, but I didn't enjoy having to redo shots and write and edit scripts and make thumbnails. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed putting the clips together in the editor, it was getting the clips that I didn't like. 

The same thing happened with graphic design, although it was less of a piecemeal attempt. Nowadays, I still use the knowledge of graphic design in various projects (I'll write a blog about one of them once it's released). Not only did I learn about cool stuff like how to manipulate paths in vector files but also about basic stuff that I've applied to school like typography and font combinations. Having a neatly laid out and organised paper goes a surprisingly long way.

Oops, I'm getting sidetracked. Consistency is a mental battle where you have to fight against yourself. Sometimes, you may have a decisive victory while other times you might end up winning by a hair. The extent of your victory isn't important, you winning is. I feel that consistency isn't a spectrum: it's binary. You've either managed to keep going with a project or you haven't. Yeah sure, you may have done something for your project but did you do as much as you promised you would?

This outlook may be a bit harsh, but I think it's impossible to deny. If anything, it can be oddly motivating. I somehow managed to get it done, but I did finish it. That's become my mindset when it comes to these 1000 word posts, to an extent. I've become less focussed on making something high quality in favour of being able to get something out the door and into the world. The prime example is this post. I'm currently at 700 words and I do not know and do not care if I'm making sense, I just want to write another 300 words and be done with this for today.

One of the ways I've been able to increase my consistency in general is by making it easier. Having a good piece of software that lets me write and publish with minimal maintenance is priceless. I currently use a combination of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). I'll explain how I set it up tomorrow, but this combination is the sole reason I'm as productive as I currently am.

Another way is having something that's slightly distracting. This means that it's not distracting to the extent that I forget about what I'm meant to be doing but something that'll take my attention away for a second or two before I remember what I'm meant to be doing and continuing to do that. This effectively resets my "I've been working for x minutes".

I personally make use of music for this and I've written about how it helps me [in a previous post](https://notes.manassadasivuni.com/0008-music/). I don't blast tunes at full volume, that doesn't help at all. Instead, I lower the volume to about 40% and play something that isn't too dynamic. I also have my volume quite low, around 10 when I have headphones on mainly because I like having intact eardrums.
