title: 1984 Part 2 Chapter 4 Analysis
---

[[Winston]] and [[Julia]] are making their relationship "official" by renting the room, showing that they are close enough to risk their lives. This also proves that [[Mr Charrington]] is a trustworthy friend, which is quite unusual given the way the [[Party]] conditions the populace.

The song sung by the red-armed [[Proles]] woman reflect [[Winston]]'s own relationship with [[Julia]]. This shows that the woman represents their need for sex. At the same time, their relationship becomes more domestic and caring, shown by the fact that [[Julia]] brought groceries for them to enjoy and [[Winston]] wished the two were an old-married couple.

The rat serves as a reality check: they are not safe. It is also used for foreshadowing.

The paperweight symbolises [[Winston]]'s and [[Julia]]'s relationship in the room: self-contained and sealed off. It also shows how easily their relationship can be broken in the same way glass is fragile.
