title: 1984 Part 3 Chapter 6 Analysis
---


This chapter serves to emphasise the extent that [[Winston]] has been taken over by the [[Party]]. It shows [[Winston]] having lost his identity and believing that the memories prior to being tortured by the [[Party]] are fake.

He has been entrusted with a higher yet almost-meaningless position within the [[Party]] and shows that he has become one with the [[Party]] and no longer has independent thoughts. This is shown when he "**almost unconsciously**" traces **2+2=5** in the dust on a table.

This is reinforced when he meets [[Julia]] by chance and that they have lost any kind of attachment to each other. This is shown in the line "**They could have lain down on the ground and done THAT if they had wanted to. His flesh froze with horror at the thought of it.**"

Interestingly, their conversation is very robotic with the repetition of each other's phrases and could show how that what made them human has been forced out. 

The bullet that he had expected when he first defied the [[Party]] is not physical but is metaphorical and is the ability to truly love [[Big Brother]] as [[O'Brien]] had previously mentioned. "**The long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain [...] He had won the victory over himself. He loved [[Big Brother]]**"
