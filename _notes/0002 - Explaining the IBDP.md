title: 0002 - Explaining the IBDP
---

For those of you who don't know, the IBDP is an alternative curriculum for the A-levels. The IB stands for the "International Baccalaureate" and the DP stands for the "Diploma Programme" and I'll be using the shorthand versions since they're a lot easier to type.

One of the main features of the IBDP that make it harder compared to other curriculums is that instead of taking three subjects (which you'd do in the A-levels), you take six academic subjects as well as three additional ones. These six subjects come from the following groups:

- Studies in language and literature
- Language Acquisition
- Individuals and Societies
- Sciences
- Maths
- The arts

### Studies in language and literature
This is effectively learning your first language and its literature. In my case, it's English, but it's available in other languages as well. 

### Language Acquisition
This is learning a foreign language, nothing special here. For the record, I take Spanish.

### Individuals and societies
This is one of the more interesting subject groups and you could call it the humanities. It's made up of a wide variety of subjects (although not all schools offer each of them):

- Business Management
- Economics
- Geography
- Global Politics
- History
- Information Technology in a Global Society (ITGS)
- Philosophy
- Psychology
- Social and Cultural Anthropology
- World Religions

The subject names are fairly self-explanatory so I won't go into detail about what they contain. I take Business Management and Economics.

### Sciences
Another one of the most interesting groups but it's not limited to the three "standard" sciences:

- Biology
- Computer Science
- Chemistry
- Design Technology
- Physics
- Sports, exercise, and health science
- Environmental systems and societies

The only interesting part of this groups is Environmental systems and societies (ESS for short). It can be taken under the science section, but if you wanted to, you could take it under Individuals and societies as well. This means that it's technically a humanities subject as well as a scientific subject. From this group, I take Physics.

### Mathematics
There are two subcategories here:

- Analysis and approaches (AA)
- Applications and interpretations (AI)

AA maths tends to be more difficult that AI maths due to the theoretical nature of it. Plus, it focusses quite heavily on calculus whereas (I think) AI maths is more based on statistics and practical applications of maths. I take AA maths.

### The arts
The arts are the more creative subjects of:

- Dance
- Music
- Film
- Theatre
- Visual arts

Taking a subject from this subject group isn't mandatory, but to ensure you still take a total of six subjects, you must take an additional subject from Individuals and societies or the sciences. This means that you're not limited to studying just Physics but can take Chemistry as well.

### SL and HL
Within each subject, there are a further two options: Standard Level and Higher Level. Some subjects will only have an SL version of them, such as Global Religions, but the vast majority of subjects have both. Half your subjects must be taken at Standard Level and the rest must be taken at Higher Level.

As it sounds like, HL variants are much more difficult and challenging, but universities tend to look mainly for your HLs. For example, to study the BSc Finance at LSE, you need to get a 766 in your HL subjects, with a 7 in HL Maths. The universities will also require a certain number of IB points, but more on the grading system later.

### IAs
IA stands for Internal Assessments. What they consist of varies for each subject, although they are usually a small research project or an experiment. They tend to account for 20% of your grade.

## The three additional subjects
### TOK
TOK stands for Theory of Knowledge. It's a very abstract and vague subject and I'd liken it to that of the Greek philosophers. For example, a recurring theme within TOK is having to ask questions, which in turn leads to more questions. Personally, I find TOK enjoyable purely because it's abstract which allows for debate and discussion.

TOK has two parts that count towards your final grade: an exhibition and an essay. The exhibition isn't solely a public presentation, it's a commentary on three objects of significance. While you do have to present it, you'll only be graded on the written commentary. The essay will have to answer a question (the IB comes up with a set of them beforehand) and come to a conclusion after looking at the various aspects of the question. The essay counts for the majority of your grade.

### CAS
CAS stands for Creativity, Activity, and Service. For this, you have to do activities that fall under one of the letters. You could write a small book for Creativity, learn a martial art for Activity and volunteer for Service. This isn't graded and doesn't have an exact measurement for when you've reached the number of required experiences or projects but it's still important. To the extent that if you fail CAS, you fail the entire IBDP by default.

### EE
EE stands for the Extended Essay. This is a research paper with a maximum word limit of 4000 words. It can be about whatever topic you want to write about, but it's best to ensure that the topic is one you can talk both about the positives and the negatives. You also have to pick a subject as your starting point, I plan to be writing my essay under Economics. I haven't figured out what the topic will be about but I'll figure that out later.

An important thing to keep in mind about the EE is that it's entirely student-driven. You have to go and approach your teachers for help, no one's going to make you do it. This is a recurring theme in the IB as a whole, for example in CAS, you have to find and take part in activities and most IAs require the student to plan it out themselves.

I haven't talked about how the IBDP is graded, but I'll add that to tomorrow's post
