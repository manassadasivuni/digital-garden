title: TOK Journal Entry 2 - Tools
---

My second real-life scenario is based on a [blog post by The Sephist](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/). The post is about how The Sephist built their own tools from scratch as opposed to the conventional approach of using pre-made software and adapting your method of working to the tool.

I believe the area of knowledge this article links to is the human sciences as it is talks about how creating our own tools allows us to fully mould our work to the way our brain functions. 

Since we are used to having to compromise ourselves and adjust ourselves, this article has led me to the knowledge question of "To what extent does the tool we choose impact our work?". This may seem like it has an obvious answer that the tool greatly matters, but there are plenty of tools that have been used in unintentional ways.

For example, the tool Notion was intended to be a combination of Microsoft Excel and Word but it was soon being used for public websites. This started off slow with singular pages, like one displaying some movies you liked but was eventually used to host entire blogs. You could also argue that the only reason this is so is because of the wide variety of blocks and modules in Notion and that another tool that's more "locked down" would be unable to expand past its intended purpose.

With this in mind, a locked down tool is unable to do more than fulfill its purpose and can cause a need for other tools to be used in tandem. I personally believe that the tool you choose will greatly impact your work but whether it has a positive or negative effect is unpredictable
