title: 1984 Part 2 Chapter 5 Analysis
---
As foreshadowed in [[1984 Part 1 Chapter 5 Analysis]], Syme had been vaporised. This sets the scene for the next paragraph which depicts how the past is being altered for Hate Week as [[Winston]] goes through past material and alters it. This shows how the [[Big Brother]] is perceived to be perfect as rather than altering his speech, the [[Party]] is moulding the past to suit him.

[[Winston]] and [[Julia]] continue to build out their home life. This innocence is portrayed through [[Mr Charrington]]'s rhymes.

The difference between [[Winston]] and [[Julia]] is evident when they discuss the policies of the [[Party]]. [[Winston]] is more concerned with the policies enforced whereas [[Julia]] only cares when the policies affect her. This shows that [[Winston]] wants to eradicate the [[Party]] completely, while [[Julia]] is content to rebel against it in a more subtle manner.

This is likely due to the fact that [[Julia]] does not remember a time when she wasn't under the surveillance of the [[Big Brother]] and sees the [[Party]] as a constant.

"**Talking to her, he realised how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatsoever of what orthodoxy meant**". This quote further emphasises the impression shown in [[1984 Part 1 Chapter 1 Analysis]] that the populace of Oceania is being brainwashed.
