title: HUS Cleanup Campaign CAS Reflection
---

One of my classmates organised a cleanup drive where volunteers could help pick up litter in the area surrounding our school. The drive went on for about 4 week and I was able to attend two of these drives.

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I first signed up, but the drive was what I thought it would be: we walked down a stretch of road that wasn't widely used and picked up the trash that we found on the sides of the road. 

The drive was more physically demanding than I thought but that's more due to it being in the sun and my lack of recent physical activity. The event was quite satisfying to take part in as I helped clean up the local environment which was gratifying. In fact, one of the drives I took part in collected around 120 kg of trash in total.

After this experience, I'd consider doing more volunteering work provided that the work is engaging or I have some people to keep me company.
