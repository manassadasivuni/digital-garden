title: HPAIR CAS Reflection
---

HPAIR is a leadership conference hosted by [[Harvard University]] that's aimed specifically at the Asia-Pacific region. One of the interesting things about the event was that their was an **application form**. This meant that you couldn't just pay the money and get in - you had to send in an application after which you'd be told whether you were accepted or not. Quite frankly, I'm not sure if any applications were rejected at all but that's not the point.

The event was held from **Jan 15th - 18th** and had many lectures and talks from prominent figures such as a **former President of Taiwan** and the **CTO of the World Bank**.

Unfortunately, most of the events were set at a time that was convenient for American and European attendees which I found quite odd as the event is for the Asia-Pacific region. In fact, **most talks happened between midnight and 9am** (local time) which made attending the conference very difficult. 

I didn't learn as much as I would have wanted as I could not a large portion of the event. This was very disappointing as I genuinely wanted to hear the thoughts of the guests they brought in. In all honesty, **I wouldn't attend another of these events** unless it's in-person as it's unlikely to be at a reasonable time and there was very little opportunity to interact with the speakers.
