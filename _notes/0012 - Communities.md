title: 0012 - Communities

A community is defined as "a unified body of individuals". This definition is quite simple but it gets the job done	but rather than debating the definition of a community, I'd rather talk about the importance of them.

As of now, there are three "professional" communities that I'm part of. The first one that I joined was the [[Obsidian]] Discord server. You remember Obsidian right? I've mentioned them in the last few posts. Anyway, the second community is a Telegram group about digital gardens run by Anne-Laure Le Cunff. Last, but certainly not least, is another Telegram group but this time about newsletters, also run by Anne-Laure.

It took me a while to get used to the community feel of them, despite that being exactly what they were trying to do. In fact, I didn't become "settled" in any of the communities until quite recently. I tended to just read messages without really commenting on them. I guess I just didn't feel the need to say what I thought even when I had something to say.

I think part of it was me only wanting to say something when I knew it was exactly what the person was looking for. This kind of goes against my "try something and adjust if it fails approach" so I've made a deliberate effort to try and talk more. So far, it's worked!

I'm mainly active on the Obsidian Discord group since the conversations there are more general and informal compared to  both Telegram groups. I think this is a reflection of why the groups were made in the first place. Obsidian made the group with the intention of forming a loyal community that they can talk to and see what the community likes. Sort of a way for them to get feedback while helping members of the community out, two birds with one stone. In addition to this, Obsidian is just a note-taking app meaning that it can be used for any purpose and is a general app.

The Telegram groups, on the other hand, were made to discuss one topic and one topic only. This does constrain what you can talk about quite a bit. Plus, I don't know what I'm doing in those groups! I joined them so that I could be with Smart People(tm) who would share their knowledge(c) with me. This means that I don't have a lot to contribute to any of the groups apart from asking questions for Smart People(tm) to answer.

This makes communication a one-way street (from my perspective at least) and renders the community aspect of the group to almost zero. I'm sure that if I were more knowledgeable about that particular topic I'd speak a lot more. It's just a shame I don't know what I'm doing.

Now that I've talked about the different communities I'm a part of, I think it makes sense to talk about what makes a good community. Just saying, these are my opinions and they may vary from person to person. A good community should have these: it should be interactive, should be large but not too large, should be beginner friendly.

If a community isn't really that interactive, there's not much point in being part of it. Having a small community would have its benefits but would also make it more at risk of becoming static and unused. At the same time, having one that's really large just causes information overload and makes it difficult for anyone else to join. This point ties in with it being beginner friendly.

I think that if you have an idea for a community and get enough interest from people, you should go for it!

Sorry that today's post was quite short. I just ran out of things to talk about.
