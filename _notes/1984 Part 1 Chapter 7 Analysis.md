title: 1984 Part 1 Chapter 7 Analysis
---


The first line of this Chapter starts with "If there is hope it lies in the [[Proles]]" and [[Winston]] is the one writing it into his diary. The narrator also says the same thing later on. The repetition could signify foreshadowing.

[[Winston]]'s diary writing and how dangerous it is is shown in the line "**Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice,
at the most, an occasional whispered word**". Furthermore, since [[Winston]]'s thoughts are written in italics, it could signify whispering

The [[Party]] could not be overthrown from within. It had to be done by an outsider, the [[Proles]]. As far as I can tell, the [[Proles]] are the lower class of Oceania and make up 85% of the population. However, they are unaware of the strength they have. [[Winston]] shows this by writing "Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious". This shows the catch 22 that the entire population suffers from.

The [[Proles]] were most likely slaves who were "liberated" by the [[Party]]. It is quite likely that this is false. The [[Party]] portrays the [[Proles]] as animals, the extent of which is shown when [[Winston]] describes their duties "to work and breed". This is emphasised with the [[Party]] slogan: "**[[Proles]] and animals are free**". This is to show that all of Chapter 7 is justifying the line "If there is hope..."

> Under the spreading chestnut tree
> I sold you and you sold me:
> There lie they, and here lie we
> Under the spreading chestnut tree

The origin of that is pre-revolution and the song is used to show dependency upon the tree. The tree is used to symbolise the "protection" of the [[Big Brother]]

> **I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY** ^i-understand-how-not-why

It could show how the [[Thought Police]] has removed the ability of people to think independently. It also shows how the propaganda does not explain the reasons for doing anything. The  proof of a world before the [[Big Brother]] is gone. [[Winston]] understands how the revolution happened as there are a lot of documents about it, but the reason for the revolution is untold. When you question "Why?", you are asking for the reason behind something. 

The passage from the children's book condemns capitalism by describing how most people did not have their basic needs met while a select few were able to lounge around in luxury. I find this to be oddly reflective of the current state of the population: there are significant shortages of almost every good (Victory Gin being the exception) while the upper [[Party]] members and the [[Big Brother]] (presumably) lounge around in total power.

> Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows

This can be paraphrased to "Freedom is the freedom to state facts".

Towards the end of the chapter, [[Winston]] realises that the [[Party]]'s greatest enemy is common sense as it is the exact opposite of doublethink.
