title: Plantation Drive CAS Reflection
---

The plantation drive was more physically exerting than the [cleanup drive](hus-cleanup-campaign-cas-reflection){:.internal-link} as we had to carry saplings to their respective hole and then cover it with dirt. By itself it wasn't too bad but since it was early morning in direct sunlight it was quite taxing after around an hour and a half.

The only thing I disliked about the drive was the fact that I won't be able to see all the saplings grow but it was still satisfying to have some positive impact on the community that will last for a decent amount of time.
