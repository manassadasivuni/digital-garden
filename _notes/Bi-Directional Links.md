title: Bi-Directional Links
---

Most links on the internet are **one-way links**. This means that they're one way pointers. For example, `Pets` --> `Dogs` means that the page `Pets` is creating a one-way link to `Dogs` **and** `Dogs` is unaware that it's being mentioned.

On the other hand, with bi-directional linking, each page knows when and where it's being mentioned - take a look at the "_Notes mentioning this note_" section for a live demo. 

This idea has been the fundamental paradigm of some note-taking apps such as [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [[Obsidian]]
