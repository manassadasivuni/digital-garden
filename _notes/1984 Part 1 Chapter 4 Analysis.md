[[Winston]]'s job is to "rectify" past speeches and articles. Aka, change them so it seems that nothing wrong ever happened. Ironically, he helps the [[Party]] maintain their iron grip over reality while he secretly defies them. Alarmingly, [[Winston]] does not consider it to be forgery or data manipulation, instead he believed it was "the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another". This is because he believes the material he's altering has no relation to the life they actually live. For example, [[Miniplenty]] had forecasted the output of boots to be 145 million however [[Winston]] was told to reduce the forecast. In reality, it was likely that no boots had been produced at all.

The highlight of [[Winston]]'s day was to rewrite an entire speech. He created a completely fictional soldier who was admirable (at least in the ideology of the [[Party]]). The seriousness with which the [[Party]] takes the task is shown by the fact that multiple writers are working on the same piece
