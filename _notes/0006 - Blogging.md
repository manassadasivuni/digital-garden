title: 0006 - Blogging

You know what blogging is right? No? That's surprising, blogs are quite popular nowadays but that's ok, I'll explain what the are. The word blog is a shortened version of the words "web" and "log". From the etymology, you can figure out that a blog is meant to be a record of thoughts.

The first blogs were in fact online diaries where the bloggers used to write about their personal lives and experiences. This kind of openness was noticed by early bloggers, causing some of them to call them "escribitionists". Since the time of online diaries, blogs have gained more purpose than being brain dumps (although some still are). They've become much more focussed on a certain topic or idea, nowadays we call that a niche.

In short, a niche is the "theme" of a website. Some blogs will talk about travel, others about productivity, some may not have a niche at all. Some, like my [main blog](https://manassadasivuni.com) do have a niche, but a vague one: me! This is what a personal blog is meant to be about. If you think about it, a personal blog is both the most narrow and open niche: they're about one single person out of billions and are also about every single aspect of you. This is what I like to refer to as "quantum niches", a term that I totally did not make up right now.

Anyway, getting back on track (slightly), a blog can be about literally anything you want it to be. Plus, it's quite cheap (even free) to set up and only takes a few hours to set up for the rest of its lifetime. If you're around my age, setting up a blog could be one of the best things you ever do! Think about it, a website showing off everything about you? One that's up to date and has a personal touch? 

It's a way to showcase your talents and your "personal style". By personal style, I mean your personality, to an extent. For example, my writing style is quite informal and direct whereas some of my friends have quite formal and eloquent styles. 

### How to get started
There's many ways to get started with your own blog. If you're in it for the long run, then I recommend you buy some WordPress hosting. WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) to the extent that it powers more than a quarter of the internet. Plus, since it's so popular, there's a lot of tutorials about how to use it. If that hasn't convinced you, there's a plethora of free plugins made by the community. I recommend checking out websites like wpbeginner.com.

If you don't want to pay that much, or just want to test out the whole blogging things, you could try a free blog from WordPress.com. Personally, I'm not a fan of sites like Wix, they don't have as much functionality as WordPress and are often significantly slower as well.

### What to write about
Here's the thing, you can write about whatever you want to. It could be something obscure like the impact of snails on the global economy, or a broad overarching topic like "food". Either way, there's no set formula to having a good blog, just a few best practices:

- Writing high quality content
- Releasing content on a regular basis
- Promote your content

That's it. The third step is optional, but it's the best way to get people to know about your blog.

If you want to make money, you'll need to have a large audience first. Once that's done, you could either run ads, or have some form of paid content. Ads are quick and easy to set up but I'm against them as it doesn't improve the relationship you have with your readers. Having paid content, like a newsletter or extra posts,  improves said relationship but is a lot more difficult to set up.

If you're doing this for the long run, I highly recommend having paid content. Not only does it earn you money, but you'll be more recognised and could turn into a mini-celebrity. Anne-Laure Le Cunff, for example, has a blog about "mindful productivity" at nesslabs.com and has a paid newsletter. She also hosts member-only events such as talks, discussion, and debates. At the moment, she has over 500 members, which at a rate of $5 a month means she consistently earns $2500 every four weeks.

Of course, having paid content is difficult and requires significantly more effort on your part to set up and maintain but it's also the more profitable model.  Ads tend to give you a few pennies for every thousand views so aren't good for the long term.

But, just like everything about your blog, you get to choose.

Hey, I know that this post wasn't even close to 1000 words, I've been really busy planning an event (more on that in the future) and I'm quite tired as I write this so here's a photo of my sleeping cat :)
