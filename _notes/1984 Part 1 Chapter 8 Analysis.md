> From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of
roasting coffeeâ€”real coffee, not Victory Coffeeâ€”came
floating out into the street.

By renaming it to "Victory ...", the [[Party]] gives it a positive connotation. By emphasising the fact that it's real coffee, the reader comes to know how deprived of common goods the population is under the control of [[Big Brother]].

> A taste for solitude

This shows how the [[Party]] is trying to create a strictly communal lifestyle and that all of the population should obey without having any individuality. This is embodied in the Newspeak word "OWNLIFE" which has a negative connotation. The [[Proles]] speak with a Cockney accent.

Repetition of the phrase "**If there is hope, it lies in the [[Proles]]**". Oddly enough, he proceeds to take a walk by himself through the [[Proles]] neighbourhoods and skipping a social event. This was likely to draw suspicion and was quite dangerous if the [[Thought Police]] find out. While there, a bomb is dropped. One of the [[Proles]] shouts at [[Winston]] as a warning which could have saved his life. Upon getting up, he sees a hand in his way and kicks it into the gutter. This shows how the [[Party]] has destroyed all signs of compassion and empathy from the population.

The [[Proles]] are distracted from their poverty by various activities such as the Lottery. [[Winston]] went into a pub and began talking to an old man for information about life before the [[Party]]. The old man stands out because he specifically asks for a pint, despite the unit not existing after the revolution. Orwell is criticising the judiciary and the royals through [[Winston]]'s belief that lawyers and priests wore top hats. Those who served the bourgeoisie were considered to be parasites and we get to know that it was actually the Labour party. The fact that the old man is unable to answer [[Winston]] shows how extensive the [[Party]] has been able to wipe out the past, even from the memories of those who witnessed it.

[[Winston]] then goes to the store where he first bought his diary and buys a paperweight. The paperweight acts as a symbol of the past, one that cannot be remade as the skill needed to make one has been wiped out. The store is owned by one of the smart [[Proles]], [[Mr Charrington]], who sold [[Winston]] the diary from [[1984 Part 1 Chapter 1 Analysis]]

[[Mr Charrington]] shows [[Winston]] how churches that still exist were used as "**a museum used for propaganda**". This is ironic as churches themselves are propaganda for a religion, meaning that one form of propaganda was replaced with another. In fact, museum's are physical symbols of propaganda as they are designed to showcase one aspect.

The phrase **jagged splinters of glass**" is used to describe the woman on the telescreen is symbolic of the [[Party]]'s power over the masses as it prevents him from thinking independently.
