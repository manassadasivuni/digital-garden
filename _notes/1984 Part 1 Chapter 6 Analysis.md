title: 1984 Part 1 Chapter 6 
---

The Chapter starts off with [[Winston]] writing in his diary, a reminder of how he is defying the [[Party]]. He even comes to recognise how his enemy is himself, in the form of how he could betray himself at any given moment. This ties into how strict and extensive the surveillance of the [[Big Brother]] is. 

The [[Party]] even goes so far as to prohibit sex, although they only encouraged it "**so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class**". The [[Party]] does this to try and prevent loyalties from forming which they cannot control. Love itself was not the enemy, eroticism was.

Marriages between [[Party]] members required permission from a committee, which would decline if the couple showed any impression of being physically attracted to each other. This shows how the [[Party]] was trying to suck all joy that they could not control out of the population's lives. In fact, the only reason marriage was even allowed was so that there could be children.

The [[Party]] was trying to kill the drive for sex, but since it couldn't stamp it out completely, they've settled with making the sex drive "dirty" and distorted.. [[Winston]]'s wife [[Katharine]] had only stayed with him for 15 months but left him as they could not produce a child. The [[Party]] did not allow for divorce but it did encourage separation in the event that they could not produce any children.

According to [[Winston]], [[Katharine]] was a completely empty shell of a person, she only thought of what the [[Party]] would want. She was so devoted to the [[Party]] that she would force [[Winston]] to have sex with her once a week as it was their duty to have a child. However, [[Katharine]] did not enjoy sex and instead "seemed to wince and stiffen" when touched by [[Winston]]. She just **submitted** herself to sex.
