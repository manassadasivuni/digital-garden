title: 0016 - Breaks

Yesterday I didn't write anything to keep up my streak of writing 1000 words a day. There's a pretty good reason for this since I was up til midnight working on a project. I did try to write before that but I had no idea what to write about. The combination of high stress and the amount of time I was working just means that I was pretty close to burning out.

I've heard about burnout and I've watched a lot of videos about how to avoid it, but it still felt unavoidable to me. One of the main things I've heard to combat burnout was to work less as opposed to relaxing more. I find this quite difficult, especially since I'm a student and I have to turn in assignments regardless of the amount of work I already have.

Online school has not helped to improve the situation of homework that I have to do. If anything it's made it worse. You see, my school has some periods where instead of having a call, we're just given a worksheet to do. The idea behind this is that we won't have to spend as much time looking at a screen.

This approach does not work as the work we're given is usually unrealistic. By this I mean that it's very difficult to complete it in the time allotted for that period. This leads us to finishing up assignments and worksheets after school hours. This also doesn't help the school to cut down on the time we spend looking at a screen as the worksheets are all digital.

Another contributing factor to the amount of work that I have to do is the fact that I'm an IBDP student. I've already written a few posts about the IB which you can see [here](https://notes.manassadasivuni.com/0002-explaining-the-ibdp/) and [here](https://notes.manassadasivuni.com/0003-my-opinion-on-the-ibdp/). One of the aspects of the IB is CAS. This means that we are required to extra curricular activities as part of school. The activity I chose to do was organise a MUN with my friends. I was voted to be the Secretary General, the CEO of the entire conference, and I had a massive deadline for today.

The point of this is that it can be very difficult to limit the amount of work that you do. The traditional advice of not taking all the work offered is geared more towards adults who are able to decline work from their jobs, in my opinion at least.

As of yet, I'm yet to find a way to effectively manage my time. I do schedule my time and I've created a [workflow](https://notes.manassadasivuni.com/0013-workflows/) that suits the way I like to work. Despite all this, I still found myself being overwhelmed. 

Anyway, going back to the topic of breaks. I think that it's important to take regular breaks. Not only from your work, but also from anything that you do. After all, you can't do something consistently all the time. You will lapse, or get extremely fed up of what you're doing. That being said, too many breaks is just as bad as having none. With this you get nothing done and are likely to not continue what you took a break from.

Breaks should also be intentional. This means that you are consciously choosing to stop working rather than getting fed up and walking away. This stops them from becoming redundant. By maintaining the intentionality of the break, you stop it from being a spontaneous distraction and ensure that it's a useful one.
