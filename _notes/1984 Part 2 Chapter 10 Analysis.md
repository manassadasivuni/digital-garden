title: 1984 Part 2 Chapter 10 Analysis
---
[[Winston]] and [[Julia]] say "**We are the dead**". This is foreshadowing as while they do not physically die, their current mindset and behaviour does. As if to confirm their realisation, [[Mr Charrington]] says "**You are the dead**" and reveals himself to be a secret member of the [[Thought Police]].

[[Mr Charrington]] then repeats the last line of the rhyme: "**Here comes a candle to light you to bed / Here comes a chopper to chop off your head**". This further emphasises that [[Winston]] and [[Julia]] are the dead.

The [[Party]] members that enter the room also break the glass paperweight which is a metaphor for how [[Winston]]'s and [[Julia]]'s relationship has been shattered. The two do not resist their capture, showing that despite knowing about the motives of the [[Party]] and [[Big Brother]] they are not able to _openly_ resist.
