title: 0013 - Workflows
---

If you do anything of any kind, I can guarantee that you have a workflow. This doesn't apply just to work, but also to something as mundane as making a cup of coffee. This is because a workflow is just the sequence of steps that make up a process. 

To make a cup of coffee (black coffee), your workflow would look something like this:
1. Boil water
2. Get mug
3. Get spoon
4. Get coffee powder
5. Use spoon to put coffee powder into the mug
6. Pour hot water into mug
7. Stir

This would give you a ~meh~ cup of coffee but it would get the job done. On the other hand, if you wanted to make a better cup of coffee, it would look something like this:
1. Boil water
2. Get French press
3. Get spoon
4. Get coffee grounds
5. Use spoon to put coffee grounds into French press
6. Pour hot water onto coffee grounds
7. Let sit for a few minutes
8. Filter the coffee grounds out
9. Get mug
10. Pour filtered coffee into mug
11. Stir

One method is shorter, more convenient, and easier but gives you an average cup of coffee. The other is longer, more difficult, and more elaborate but gives you a much better cup of coffee. Which one is better?

Regardless of which option you choose, some will agree with you and others will say that you're wrong. This is because all of us have our own preferred way of making coffee (some may even choose not to have coffee). This is a clear way of illustrating how all of us have different workflows for work. In fact, our workflows are likely to change as time goes on.

For example, I used to use an app called Notion to take all of my notes. I even used it to start organising my personal life! This was mainly about stuff I had to do and a short-lived journal. Over time, I stopped maintaining my life with Notion and used it primarily as a note-taking tool. Then there was a game changer.

I discovered Obsidian quite a while ago, but didn't use it as much as I should've. Instead, it served as a way for me to take rough notes in my class that I would then make a neater version of in Notion. This was quickly thrown out the window as Obsidian's backlinks feature, which promoted free-floating information, began to clash with Notion's hierarchical way of storing pages.

At this point, I'd settled upon what I thought was a good balance: I'd take all my notes in Obsidian and only use Notion to keep track of tasks. This worked. Not very long though. I just couldn't be bothered with having to update my Notion database whenever I got a new piece of work (especially when I'd get two or three pieces of work in the same day). I eventually relapsed to the "leaving notification emails unread until I finished the task". This works because I read _all_ my mail which means that if an email hasn't been read, there's a reason behind it.

I still use the email system til today and I've also started making a new note in Obsidian for each day which includes some tasks that I have to do as well as a table with some rough timings of when I'll be doing the tasks. This helped me **a lot**. Last Saturday, I knew that I had a lot to get done that day an began scheduling my tasks, only to realise that I had a massive chunk of time in the afternoon that I could use to relax.

Whoops, I've just went on a bit of a tangent but whatever. Anyway, back to workflows. I've found that the best apps or programs are the ones that allow for flexibility while also making you use them in the way they were built to be used. This lets you adjust the app to how you want to work and makes sure that you use the app for the reason you picked it in the first place.

Of course, you could go one step further than picking an app and customising it. You could just build your own app that suits you perfectly. Plus if you notice that you're using a certain feature more than others, you could easily add in or remove some elements to adjust the app to your new referred workflow. Of course, you'll need to know how to code quite well but it would be an interesting experiment.

I doubt I'll ever have the motivation to build a fully custom app myself, but I'm pretty sure some of you out there will. Not only that, I don't really know who I work best. This is partly because I'm used to adjusting the way I work to whatever tool I'm using as opposed to the other way round. I think that this would be a nice experiment to conduct where a group of developers each build a tool that suits their workflow perfectly before seeing what features were common to each developer as well as which features were completely unique.

If you're a developer, you know what to do :)
