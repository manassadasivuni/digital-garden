title: 1984 Part 2 Chapter 8 Analysis

[[Winston]] arrives at [[O'Brien]]'s house with [[Julia]] showing the level of trust given by [[Winston]] as he shows another one of his crimes to [[O'Brien]]: his relationship.

[[O'Brien]] turns off the telescreen showing that he is a trusted member of the [[Party]]. It also lures [[Winston]] and [[Julia]] into a false sense of security as [[O'Brien]] is a member of the [[Thought Police]]. The implication of this is that [[O'Brien]] is so trusted by the [[Party]] that he is able to replace a telescreen.

While [[Winston]] and [[Julia]] are prepared to do horrifying acts (such as maim a child), they are not prepared to leave each other. This fact is used against them and is ironic.

The line said by [[O'Brien]] "**It is necessary for us to know everything**" is an example of dramatic irony as [[Winston]] and [[Julia]] believe he will use the information to make the best strategy possible for the rebellion while in reality, he intends to use it against them. There are other lines with dramatic irony such as "**even if he survives, it may be as a different person**", "**Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition**". These lines are also used for foreshadowing.

Another example of irony is in the sentence "**You will receive orders and you will obey them, without knowing why**" as this is the method used by the [[Party]], the very organisation [[Winston]] and [[Julia]] are rebelling against. "**Wait. The decanter is still half full**". This could be related to a sense of optimism which [[O'Brien]] is trying to convey. 

"**the place where there is no darkness**" could be used to show that [[Winston]] will be under complete surveillance as darkness offers a space to hide. However, it could also use darkness to signify ignorance which would then imply that they will meet in a place where all information is accessible.

In the context of the current time, these two meanings appear simultaneously: all information is accessible to us and we are under constant surveillance from tech companies.
