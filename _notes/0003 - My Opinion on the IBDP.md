title: 0003 - My Opinion on the IBDP
---

Before I get into what I think of the IB Diploma Programme, I mentioned in my last post ([available here](https://notes.manassadasivuni.com/0002-explaining-the-ibdp/)) that I'd explain how the IBDP is graded. I'm not going to go into the details of each subject, but more of an overarching view of the system.

Instead of the traditional letter grade of an A, B, C, etc, the IB has numbers. With this system, a 7 is the highest possible grade and 1 is the lowest. For any subject, the minimum pass grade is a 4, meaning that a 1, 2, or 3 is a fail.

The exceptions to the above are [TOK](https://notes.manassadasivuni.com/0002-explaining-the-ibdp/#tok) and the [EE](https://notes.manassadasivuni.com/0002-explaining-the-ibdp/#ee). These still have letter grades, but the combination of letter grades is converted into numbers.

In total, the IBDP has a maximum of 45 points. Whichever grade you get in your subjects are added up to make your score but since there are six subjects and a maximum of seven points, you can only get up to 42 points by subjects alone. The remaining 3 points come from TOK and EE using this matrix.

To pass the IBDP overall, you need a minimum of 24 points, although competitive universities like Oxford, Cambridge and LSE require at least 36 points and have more selective criteria (like requiring a certain grade in maths)

## My thoughts
Now that the grading system is out of the way, here's what I feel about it. The way that the work is graded is fair, we should only get the grade we deserve. However, the jump between grades is high, especially for moving from a 6 to a 7. This is because a "7" essentially means a perfect (or near perfect) score whereas a "6" is more of an above average score. In other words, a 6 is as difficult as an A*, but a 7 is twice as difficult.

While the grading system itself and the way it's designed could be improved upon, the actual things the IB teaches you are quite useful. For example, the EE can be likened to a university thesis quite easily and TOK helps you to make more sense of contradicting information and sources. As for CAS, it makes you try out different hobbies and activities, which could lead you to finding one you love.

That being said, the IB also has quite a few negatives. The main and most obvious one is the stress the IB has a reputation for. This is so extreme that the second year of the IB has been claimed to be harder than a normal semester at Harvard University. This has led, and will continue to lead, to mental health issues for students who aren't able to cope up with the intense workload. Furthermore, the effects of this stress may not be initially apparent, making them harder to combat. When combined with the normalisation of sacrificing your own health to do slightly better in school, the IB can be said to be dangerous.

Of course, you could decide to _just not take the IB_. But the same effects (to a lesser extent) will still be visible. This is due to how the education system, regardless of where it is or what it teaches, is essentially a machine. I've previously covered the same topic in [an earlier blog post](https://manassadasivuni.com/the-problem-with-the-education-system/) but I would like to re-state my opinion as well as talk about some points raised in the [comments](https://manassadasivuni.com/the-problem-with-the-education-system/#comments).

The education system is standardised. The same approach is taken when teaching each and every child, with all of them being pushed to do the same set of activities. What's even more shocking is that the education system was largely created during the Industrial Revolution, where it was believed that "street urchins" would not be able to understand complex topics such as maths and the system paid little attention to creating a way to ensure they stayed in school. 

While going to school is mandatory in most countries, ensuring a child learns is not. Instead, they must pass through a few tests and they'll be moved up where they'll learn more difficult and intricate topics using a half-laid foundation. It is no surprise that schools do not function as well as they should. 

Of course, taking a truly personalised approach is likely to be resource intensive and is unlikely to be feasible on a large-scale. For now, at least.
