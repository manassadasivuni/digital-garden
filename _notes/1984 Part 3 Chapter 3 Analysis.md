title: 1984 Part 3 Chapter 3 Analysis

"**There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance**". The learning could refer to how [[Winston]] had to learn how to make use of doublethink and how  the [[Party]] has complete control over Oceania. Understanding could refer to the fact that there is no hope or point in trying to defy the [[Party]].

[[O'Brien]] has reduced the amount of torture [[Winston]] suffers which could show that [[Winston]] is already broken and that he will be compliant to whatever [[O'Brien]] asks of him.

[[O'Brien]] explains that he wrote THE BOOK ([[1984 Part 2 Chapter 9 Analysis]]) and that the [[Proles]] could never revolt.

He also explains that the [[Party]] wants power for power's sake - not because they believe they are protecting society from itself. "**we are interested solely in power, _pure power_ \[italics added]**". [[O'Brien]] says that the reason the Nazis and Russian Communists were "**cowards and hypocrites**" for not recognising their own motives.

> "**Power is not a means, it is an end**"

> "**The object of power is power**"

[[O'Brien]] takes the [[Party]]'s obsession with power further and claims that since it controls the minds of people, it controls matter. He also raises a pretty interesting question: **How can we say something existed if no one witnessed it?**

He brings this question up to say that the Earth has only existed for as long as the [[Party]] has existed. This is similar to the ideology of [[RenÃ© Descartes]]

> "**Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation**"

[[Winston]] believes that eventually human nature will overcome the [[Party]] and that the [[Party]] would be overthrown.

[[Winston]] believes that he is still human because he has not betrayed [[Julia]].
