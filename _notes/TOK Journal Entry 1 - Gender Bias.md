title: TOK Journal Entry 1 - Gender Bias
---

My real-life situation is based on the book "Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men" by Caroline Criado Perez. As of yet, I've read the preface and the introduction which discussed how women are systematically hampered by a plethora of cultural and legal issues, partly as a result of data bias.

This is linked to the human sciences as it concerns how half the population is largely ignored and the economic and social impacts of doing so.

The points raised in the book have led me to the knowledge question of "To what extent does the exclusion of women impact our society in a negative manner?". This question is becoming more popular and prevalent due to the recent feminist movement and should be taken deeply into consideration. For one, the "system" is rigged against women. A stark example of this is how public transport is set up: transport links leading to the city centre and back out.

This isn't much of a problem for the male half as their primary reason to travel is to go to work. On the other hand, women are significantly more likely to take part in "trip-chaining". This means that on the way to work, a woman is likely to drop their child off at school, then pick up medicines or another necessity. Unfortunately, public transport is set up in a way that doesn't allow for trip-chaining to be easy. 

One factor is that the physical locations of bus stands and metro stations are not near to other transport links that aid trip-chaining and the other is that lawmakers do not account for trip-chaining when setting up infrastructure. This is due to the fact that they are used to only thinking about the needs of men, treating women as an add-on with no special requirements.

While the knowledge question will be difficult to answer accurately, due to male bias (regardless of your gender) it is one that must be accounted for as we build the future. However, answering the question posed won't create significant change, implementing the answer and our findings will. This change will require conscious effort - necessary effort - to overcome our old patterns of thinking, of course.
