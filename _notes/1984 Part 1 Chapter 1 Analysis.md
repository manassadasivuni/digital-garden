title: 1984 Part 1 Chapter 1 Analysis

Repetition of the phrase "[[Big Brother]] IS WATCHING YOU" could signify the constant surveillance of the telescreen and [[Minitrue]]. This ties in quite well with the monotonousness of the telescreen which could signify that it serves as a constant reminder that they (the population) are being monitored.

The description of London is very WWII-esque. This could be interpreted to imply that the book speaks about a world where Nazi Germany won WWII. The constant monitoring and oppression certainly reflect that of Hitler's, albeit with less technological reliance.

"[[Winston]] kept his back turned to the telescreen" shows the fear and distrust that (presumably) all citizens have for the government or whatever form of authority there is (dictatorship maybe??)

[[Minitrue]] (Ministry of Truth) building has the three slogans of the Party:
	1. War is peace
	2. Freedom is slavery
	3. Ignorance is strength

These slogans show how the Party is trying to brainwash the population, to the extent that the meaning of a word is changed. Interestingly, rather than saying "ignorance is bliss", Orwell chose to write "ignorance is strength". This could be because not knowing the terrible deeds or happenings allows one to focus themselves on the task at hand, creating an illusion of mental strength.

The four Ministries are [[Minitrue]] (Ministry of Truth which controls the flow of information), [[Minipax]] (Ministry of Peace which deals with war), [[Miniluv]] (Ministry of Love which maintains law and order), and [[Miniplenty]] (Ministry of Plenty which deals with economic affairs.

The irony in [[Minipax]] dealing with war is obvious. The Ministry may have been named so that the population associate peace with war, as per the Party slogan. By using [[Miniluv]] to maintain law and order (presumably through force) Orwell hints at the manipulation caused by the Party and the actions they take in the name of the population. This impression is cemented when [[Miniluv]] is described as "the really frightening one" and the barriers are mentioned ("a maze of barbed-wire")

The lack of freedom and choice of the population is emphasised when [[Winston]] is forced to have "Victory Gin" and "Victory Cigarettes" as his lunch. More worrying is the effect of the Victory Gin: "the world began to look more cheerful". This could imply that the Victory Gin is used to aid in the controlling of the population by making them believe the regime isn't as bad as it seems.

The diary appears to fascinate [[Winston]], probably because such an object is rare due to the punishments that will be meted if caught. The inability to confidently write down the date shows the extent to which the Party is going to ensure that they are the only ones who are able to write historical records. [[Winston]] appears to know that the diary will serve such as purpose as he questions how one can communicate with the future.

**Note: We find out the diary was sold to him by [[Mr Charrington]]**

The manner in which he wrote in the diary seems to hint at a fear of being caught as well as a sense of urgency to write down what he had seen. The urgency seems to be an emotional revulsion towards the movie in which a Jewish mother (ties in quite nicely with the Hitler alternate reality) is shown being blown up to which the audience _laughs_.

After [[Winston]]'s flashback, he discovers that he's filled half a page with the words "DOWN WITH [[Big Brother]]". This reveals his true nature - albeit privately - showing that he may not be completely brainwashed.
