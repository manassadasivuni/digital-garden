# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is an unconvential sort of blog. Instead of posts in a chronological order, it's more of a web of interlinked notes that you're meant to lose yourself in. It's heavily inspired by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) but about topics more personal to me.

If you don't know much about me, head over to the [[about]] page.

> To fully understand these notes, see [[How These Notes Are Structured]]
