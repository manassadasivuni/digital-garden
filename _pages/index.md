# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is an unconvential sort of blog. Instead of posts in a chronological order, it's more of a web of interlinked notes that you're meant to lose yourself in. It's heavily inspired by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) but about topics more personal to me. The notes here may not be finished and are written mainly for myself. If you don't understand a note, that's probably becuase it wasn't written for you to understand. Sorry Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

If you don't know much about me, head over to the [[about]] page.

> To fully understand these notes, see [[How These Notes Are Structured]]

# Entry points
These notes are unlikely to have _any_ content in them - at most, they may have a definition or explanation of the topic. Look at which notes link to them to start reading. These are a select few topics that I'm writing about currently. To see the full list of Indexes, see [[Index]].
